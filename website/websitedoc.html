            For the responsive website assignment, I decided to create a personal website for myself. Since I want the website to reflect a little on my personality, I chose soft colors - light blue and pink. I also chose patterns I liked and used them to separate the different sections. I mirrored the first and third section with the same pattern, and left the middle section with its own pattern to show that separation. I used icons for navigation to link to other websites that the user can browse through. In addition to a brief description about myself, I included some of my featured projects and website designs.
